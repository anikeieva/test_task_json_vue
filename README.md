# test_task_json_vue

This is a test project. In it was realized outputing test json data
to the HTML table and live search by separate fields. Also there is
counting total currency(fourth table's field).

Project was created with the help of Vue.js, vue-cli. Also I worked with:
Webpack, Sass, ES6.
